🔢 Array Visualizer

Array Visualizer is an interactive web application that combines Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with modern frontend development to help users visually understand how array operations and algorithms work step by step.

🚀 Project Motivation

After solving hundreds of DSA problems, I wanted to move beyond console-based solutions and build something practical, visual, and educational.
This project is an attempt to bridge the gap between DSA concepts and real-world development, turning abstract logic into clean, interactive visual experiences.


✨ Features

🎨 UI & Experience
Dark Mode & Light Mode
Adjustable animation speed
Responsive design
Clean and intuitive UI using Tailwind CSS

📊 Visualization Options
Bar View
Square/Grid View

🔢 Array Controls
Set custom array
Generate random array
Real-time updates during operations


🧩 DSA Operations Visualized
🔹 Basic Operations
1. Traverse
2. Insert
3. Delete
4. Update

🔍 Searching Algorithms
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

🔄 Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort

Each operation is animated to clearly show how the algorithm progresses internally.


📝 Feedback System
The project includes a fully integrated feedback form, connected directly to Google Forms with Gmail notifications.
The form collects:
Name, Email, Feedback Type, Message, Linear Rating

This helps gather real user feedback and improves the project iteratively.
