# 🔢 Array Visualizer
Array Visualizer is an interactive web application that combines Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) with modern frontend development to help users visually understand how array operations and algorithms work step by step.

<br>

# 🚀 Project Motivation
After solving hundreds of DSA problems, I wanted to move beyond console-based solutions and build something practical, visual, and educational. <br>
This project is an attempt to bridge the gap between DSA concepts and real-world development, turning abstract logic into clean, interactive visual experiences.

# ✨ Features

### 🎨 UI & Experience
Dark Mode & Light Mode <br>
Adjustable animation speed<br>
Responsive design<br>
Clean and intuitive UI using Tailwind CSS<br>

### 📊 Visualization Options
Bar View<br>
Square/Grid View

### 🔢 Array Controls
Set custom array<br>
Generate random array<br>
Real-time updates during operations<br>


# 🧩 DSA Operations Visualized
### 🔹 Basic Operations
1. Traverse
2. Insert
3. Delete
4. Update

### 🔍 Searching Algorithms
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

### 🔄 Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort

Each operation is animated to clearly show how the algorithm progresses internally.


### 📝 Feedback System
The project includes a fully integrated feedback form, connected directly to Google Forms with Gmail notifications. <br>
The form collects: ***Name, Email, Feedback Type, Message, Linear Rating***

This helps gather real user feedback and improves the project iteratively.
